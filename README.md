# CF40A/CF48D Iterative Tuning Process

This is going to be a repo for all the tuning I've been doing to my car's ECU. These contain back-to-stock ROMs for both CF40A and CF48D ECUs. I'm making this so people can just nab these tunes I've modified. This repo is for the CF40A and CF48D ECUs and related. The CF40A has some definitions available, but they are far less defined than the CF48D. Plus, if you have a CF40A ECU, flash the stock CF48D and it will be the same in terms of drivability. 

## CREDITS
MASSIVE thanks to [Pytrex](https://github.com/Pytrex) for his [Nissan Definitions](https://github.com/Pytrex/NissanDefinitions) repo. Without him, this wouldn't be possible whatsoever.

Also a GIGANTIC thanks to [Fenugrec](https://github.com/fenugrec) for making [Nisprog](https://github.com/fenugrec/nisprog), the open-source Nissan flasher/dumper.

Also huge credit to everyone on [RomRaider](https://www.romraider.com/) for helping out!

My friend Johnathan who also has a CF48D 350z, to which I compared Pytrex's to and both were the same. For all intents and purposes, they both helped confirm this ECU to be usable in CF40A, though I will also want to thank [bradsm87](https://www.romraider.com/forum/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&u=15839) for also confirming this on the forum!

All of these people have made it possible to further the open-source nature of tuning. Support them if you can! If not, at least make sure to make use of their work to learn from!

## WARNING
**TUNING IS DANGEROUS AND POTENTIALLY ILLEGAL. ALWAYS CHECK YOUR LOCAL LAWS BEFORE TUNING. I CLAIM NO RESPONSIBILITY FOR MISUSE OF THESE FILES OR DAMAGE THEY MAY CAUSE TO YOUR VEHICLE. ALL OF THESE FILES WERE CONFIGURED ON A STOCK 2006 350Z TOURING 5A VEHICLE UNLESS DENOTED OTHERWISE. BE INCREDIBLY CAREFUL WHEN FLASHING ROMS.**


## What cars does this apply to?

These ECUs *only* apply to the Nissan 350z, non-rev-up, touring, 5-speed automatic. Realistically, ECUs are interchangeable throughout the years so long as you have the same engine type. These tunes will NOT work if you have a CD009 transmission. These will only work on the VQ35DE engine which is 287 HP/291 PS. My Z has the Bi-xenon projectors, updated front fascia, etc - the 2006 version. These tunes may fit the other models, but I'll need someone braver than me to test that out... Feel free to push changes at any time and I'll review!

### These are the following ECUs that have been replaced by the 23710-CF48D ECUs:
23710-CF40A, 23710-CF40D, more unknown maybe? Those two are confirmed with Nissan FAST, however, so if you grab your ECUID and you have one of these, I heavily suggest upgrading.
