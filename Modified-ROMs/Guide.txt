Identifier Help:
Each identifier is shown by a two-letter set of characters, separated by a dash, to tell you what type of tune you're getting. This way, you can almost sort of custom-tune your own vehicle based on preset tables created.

HS:

High Speed (increased top speed to 255mph (0x8a4c), effectively removing the speed limiter and fuel cutoff (0x8542) and restoring (0x854e) switches)

BO:

Burnout (TVO bypass from APO threshold (0x8748). This makes sure the brake pedal doesn't cut the throttle, so you should be able to do a left-foot brake standing burnout. REMINDER: THIS IS A SAFETY FEATURE. YOU SHOULD STILL BE ABLE TO STOP WHILE SLAMMING ON BRAKES AND THROTTLE SIMULTANEOUSLY, BUT STILL BE CAREFUL - IT'LL BE A LOT SLOWER, AND YOU'LL SLIDE IF YOU HAVE TCS OFF!)

ND:

No Delay (CL to OL Delay set to 0s (0x7fda). Allows faster switching from CL to OL on wide open throttle. May cause issues on idle, haven't done extensive testing yet...)
