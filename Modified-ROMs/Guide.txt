HS = High speed (increased top speed to 255, effectively removing the top speed entirely)
BO = Burn out (TVO bypass from APO threshold. Basically, makes sure that the brake pedal doesn't cut the throttle. REMINDER: THIS IS A SAFETY FEATURE. YOU SHOULD STILL BE ABLE TO STOP, BUT BE CAREFUL!)
ND = No Delay (CL to OL Delay set to 0s. Allows faster switching from CL to OL. May cause issues on idle, haven't done extensive testing yet.)
